# Booklet

Heavily inspired by [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl)

# Compiling the PDF
Install the following packages (`sudo apt install <package>` on Ubuntu):
- make
- cmake
- texlive
- texlive-latex-extra
- texlive-fonts-recommended
- texlive-fonts-extra

Then run `make` to build the PDF. `make clean` removes build artifacts, `make distclean` removes artifacts and the compiled PDF. `make test` runs unit tests.
